# VBUC transforms desktop apps to .NET and web

## Preserve business logic and algorithms

Unlike a rewrite, VBUC moves existing back-end logic to the new platform, keeping proven and debugged logic and processes intact and dramatically reducing the total defects to be resolved following the migration.

## Why should I upgrade my VB 6.0 applications to .NET?

There are several drivers for a VB to .NET migration:

Integrate Windows, Web, Office and Mobile solutions
Boost system performance
Ease deployment
Improve the maintenance of an application
Increase developer productivity
Consolidate your company's valuable software assets
Avoid obsolescence of outdated software [support for VB 6 ended on April 8th, 2008 ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6-support-policy?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

## Upgraded Stubs
When a library a library has some classes, properties, methods or events that aren't already supported an Upgrade Stub will be generated.
An Upgrade Stub is a "mock" class. 

``` C#
public class MSXML2_XMLHTTP30
{
   public string getresponseText()
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.responseText");
   return "";
   }
   public void open(string bstrMethod, string bstrUrl, object varAsync, object bstrUser, object bstrPassword)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.open");
   }
   public void send(object varBody)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.send");
   }
}
```
