# What to see some samples ?

We are sure that you will like to see what the VBUC can do for you.

* You can take a look at our [Reference Sample Application called Salmon King Seafood (SKS)](https://github.com/MobilizeNet/SKS). This is a fictions company that sells seafood. We provide the VB6 code as well as the migrated code to C#, to .NET Core and to ASP.NET Core.
* We also prepared with Microsoft an extended sample for their [Tailwind Azure Demos](https://azureappsdemomap.com/tailwind) this demo is a Point of Sale Application that is [migrated from VB6 to Desktop and then to Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/TailwindTraders-PointOfSale).  

# VBUC transforms desktop apps to .NET and web

Unlike a rewrite, VBUC moves existing back-end logic to the new platform, keeping proven and debugged logic and processes intact and dramatically reducing the total defects to be resolved following the migration.

There are several drivers for a VB to .NET migration:

Integrate Windows, Web, Office and Mobile solutions
Boost system performance
Ease deployment
Improve the maintenance of an application
Increase developer productivity
Consolidate your company's valuable software assets
Avoid **obsolescence of outdated software** [support for VB 6 ended on April 8th, 2008 ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6-support-policy?redirectedfrom=MSDN).
Maintain competitive advantage

## [Dealing with UnResolved References](https://www.mobilize.net/blog/vbuc-expert-mode)

Whenever you're trying to convert a VB6 or Classic ASP application to .NET with the Visual Basic Upgrade Companion it is recommended that you do so in an environment where the source application can be built and executed. This will ensure all the required references are correctly registered in that environment. Sometimes, however, VBUC will still show some errors in the "Resolve References" ....

In VB6 public variables defined in standard (.bas) modules aren’t really “global variables”.
These public variables are scoped [at the apartment level](

the [BinaryCompatibility setting](http://blogs.artinsoft.net/Mrojas/archive/2010/06/24/Interop-BinaryCompatibilty-for-VB6-Migrations.aspx) to make sure that your applications did not break after a change.

## Upgraded Stubs
When a library a library has some classes, properties, methods or events that aren't already supported an Upgrade Stub will be generated.
An Upgrade Stub is a "mock" class. 

``` C#
public class MSXML2_XMLHTTP30
{
   public string getresponseText()
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.responseText");
   return "";
   }
   public void open(string bstrMethod, string bstrUrl, object varAsync, object bstrUser, object bstrPassword)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.open");
   }
   public void send(object varBody)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.send");
   }
}
```
