# VBUC transforms desktop apps to .NET and web

## Preserve business logic and algorithms

Unlike a rewrite, VBUC moves existing back-end logic to the new platform, keeping proven and debugged logic and processes intact and dramatically reducing the total defects to be resolved following the migration.

## Why should I upgrade my VB 6.0 applications to .NET?

## Upgraded Stubs
When a library a library has some classes, properties, methods or events that aren't already supported an Upgrade Stub will be generated.
An Upgrade Stub is a "mock" class. 

``` C#
public class MSXML2_XMLHTTP30
{
   public string getresponseText()
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.responseText");
   return "";
   }
   public void open(string bstrMethod, string bstrUrl, object varAsync, object bstrUser, object bstrPassword)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.open");
   }
   public void send(object varBody)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.send");
   }
}
```
