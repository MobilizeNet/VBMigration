![VBUC](https://www.mobilize.net/hs-fs/hubfs/1webSITE-Images/Images/Mobilize-VBUC.png)


# VBUC transforms desktop apps to .NET and web

## Preserve business logic and algorithms

Unlike a rewrite, VBUC moves existing back-end logic to the new platform, keeping proven and debugged logic and processes intact and dramatically reducing the total defects to be resolved following the migration.

## Why should I upgrade my VB 6.0 applications to .NET?

There are several drivers for a VB to .NET migration:

Integrate Windows, Web, Office and Mobile solutions
Boost system performance
Ease deployment
Improve the maintenance of an application
Increase developer productivity
Consolidate your company's valuable software assets
Avoid obsolescence of outdated software [support for VB 6 ended on April 8th, 2008 ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6-support-policy?redirectedfrom=MSDN).
Maintain competitive advantage

## [Dealing with UnResolved References](https://www.mobilize.net/blog/vbuc-expert-mode)

Whenever you're trying to convert a VB6 or Classic ASP application to .NET with the Visual Basic Upgrade Companion it is recommended that you do so in an environment where the source application can be built and executed. This will ensure all the required references are correctly registered in that environment. Sometimes, however, VBUC will still show some errors in the "Resolve References" ....

These public variables are scoped at the apartment level.

Exposing C# Classes thru Interop

One of those subtle details is that the tlbexp tool (this is the tool that generates the .tlb for a .NET assembly)
generates a prefix for enum elements.

## Upgraded Stubs
When a library a library has some classes, properties, methods or events that aren't already supported an Upgrade Stub will be generated.
An Upgrade Stub is a "mock" class. 

``` C#
public class MSXML2_XMLHTTP30
{
   public string getresponseText()
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.responseText");
   return "";
   }
   public void open(string bstrMethod, string bstrUrl, object varAsync, object bstrUser, object bstrPassword)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.open");
   }
   public void send(object varBody)
   {
      UpgradeHelpers.Helpers.NotUpgradedHelper.NotifyNotUpgradedElement("MSXML2.XMLHTTP30.send");
   }
}
```
